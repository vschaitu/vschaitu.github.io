                    <q>"Live as if you die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever" – <i>Mahatma Gandhi</i></q><br><br>
                    <p>I like this quote and I always try to live by it. I am a “simple man” if you ask me in single word. I am always passionate to learn new things, whether its related to my profession or anything causal. I believe a life’s most worth is to “experience” and cherish good things we have done.</p><br>
                    <p>From last 12 years I am working in Information Technology(IT) field, started my career as a programmer to currently managing a small dev team where we provide maintenance , development, support of various IT applications over full SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle).</p><br>    
                    <p>My programming skill set includes C, shell scripting, IBM Mainframe technologies - Cobol, Jcl, CICS, MQ based xml services, Pacbase, Relation programming patterns, Rational develops tools ,Document generation tool - Opentext Extreme. I have handful of working experience with both hierarchical legacy databases(IMS) to  relationship databases(IBM DB2). When it comes to soft skills , I have excellent understanding and experience in various SDLC methods such as Waterfall and agile. Also I was part of all various SDLC life-cycles, right from project start up phase to requirement gathering, estimation, design , develop, test deploy and support.</p><br>
                    <p>Besides work , I like sports movies and music. And I am always a big sports fan and have huge respect to athletes and sports persons. They are my childhood heroes and my inspiration. I love cricket, soccer , badminton & table tennis. Probably I would have chosen my field around sports, if it was not IT. I come from a traditional Indian family and my hometown is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visakhapatnam" target="_blank">Visakhapatnam</a>, and is one of the beautiful coastal area in Southern India. And other things that interest me is people & culture and it's so fascinating to see and understand different cultures and how each have their own way of doing.</p><br>
